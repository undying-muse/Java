print(" ")

//Java is close to C++ and C#, 
//every application should begin with a class name, 
//and that class must match the filename.

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {    
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}

/*For now, just remember that every Java program has a 
class name which must match the filename, and that every 
program must contain the main() method.*/

/*I wrote some of the stuff the w3 schools gave me (public&not mine) 
but I have literally no idea what I should be doing yet.*/

//Note: The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.

//System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, 
//such as out, which is short for "output". The println() method, short 
//for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).

//Don't worry too much about System, out and println(). Just know 
//that you need them together to print stuff to the screen.

//You should also note that each code statement must end with a 
//semicolon (;).

//Ohhh so thats where the semicolon obsession comes from. I didn't know that Java 
//NEEDED the semicolons.


public class MyClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
   System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}


//My first command!! 

//And funny story I mixed that with printIn. Yeah... dyslexia.
//Anyways back to learning.

System.out.println("Hello World!");
System.out.println("I am learning Java.");
System.out.println("It is awesome!");
Semicolons!!!
//I'm having fun with this Afdkfhdskf

//note: must not forget the quotes when using println command
//There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().

System.out.print("Hello World! ");
System.out.print("What's up?");

//the print function prints whatever's inside on the same line as println
//Note that we add an extra space (after "Hello World!" in the example above), for better readability.
//oooooo so the print doesnt leave any space behind as well. cool!


//Seems like we can print the numbers and equations as well.

//Look!
System.out.print(200);
System.out.print(5*10);
System.out.print(2+3);

//I learned how to use comments!!
//It was a little disorienting because I was used to the hash symbol instead of the
//two slashes.

System.out.print(2+3); //Note, they work in the middle of llines!!
